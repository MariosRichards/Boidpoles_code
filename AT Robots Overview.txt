General Info

Arena 1000,1000
(0,0) is upper left corner, (1000,1000) is lower-right

Angles represent as 256 degree circle
- 0/256 is North, 64 is East, 128 is South, 192 is West

Robot have
- size (radius =4)
- armour (hitpoints) 100 hitpoints
- scanner
- weapon
	shots deal damage based on accuracy to everyone within range
	(i.e. point blank shot can damage yourself)
- overburn status (generates more heat, shots move faster, robot moves faster)
- turning/accelerating robot takes time
- turret moves instantly

Damage
- collisions	1
- various levels of heat deal 1pt from 1/64 cycles to 1/4 cycles ... then explode robot
- missile blast 14-distance
- robot detonation 25-distance
- mine blast 35-distance
(overburn missile blast damage + 25%, overburn robot detonate damage +30%)


  Robot performance:              per game cycle:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Robot radius                      4 meters
   Normal missile velocity:         32 meters
   Maximum non-overburn speed:       4 meters
   Turn rate:                        8 degrees
   Acceleration                      4% of max forward speed
   Turret rotation                  Instantaneous

Heat effects
============

     80+   Max speed reduced to 98%
    100+   Max speed reduced to 95%.
    150+   Max speed reduced to 85%.
    200+   Max speed reduced to 70%.
    250+   Max speed reduced to 50%.
    300+   Heat starts burning armor off (the hotter, the faster)
    400+   Robot stops executing commands until cools below 350 (shutdown -> speed 0)
    500+   Robot explodes.
(robots can change their shutdown temperature from the default!)

Normal heat exchanges:  (can be altered with robot configs)
======================
    Firing weapon:                 20
    Dissipation per game cycle:     1   ( +1/8 if throttle is -25% to 25% )

Overburn effects
================
             1) faster driving speed                          (130%)
             2) weapon does more damage                       (125%)
             3) weapon projectiles move faster                (125%)
             4) weapon generates more heat                    (150%)
             5) nastier explosion from death or self-destruct (130%)
             6) worse heat dissipation                        ( 66%)
(note: these effect your base speed - i.e. you're still running at 100% throttle, it's just the base speed is 30% higher)

Scanner:   This is the maximum range your scanner can see.
Weapon:    A multiplier placed upon your missiles damage, speed, and heat.
Armor:     Two multipliers:   1. Armor multiplier   2. Speed multiplier
Engine:    This is the multiplier applied to your maximum speed.
Heatsinks: Change in heat dissipation (multiplier).
Mines:     This is the number of mines you start the battle with.
Shield:    It takes at least 3 points to get one. Blocks damage

  Shield damage blocking:

  Weak:    2/3 damage gets through, and 2/3 converted to heat. (1/3 overlap)
  Medium:  1/2 damage gets through, other half turned to heat.
  Strong:  1/3 damage gets through, and 1/3 converted to heat.


Hardware Robot Game Cycle
=========================


(1)   Run CPU (cpu may trigger hardware actions like firing weapon which have hardware sideeffects)
(2)   Check Heat - apply effects (e.g. damage/explode)
(3)   Check Hit Points (e.g. is it now dead? If so, explode)
(4)   Move
        - Check for collisions
		- Update damage, check for death
		
<end turn>
  



Shot/Mine Cycle
===============

(1) Check if shot detonates (on robot or wall)
(2) Calculate damage (modified by distance/robot armour config/shield)
    - Requires going through all robots and checking distance
	- Did it kill it?


(Robots can detonate, mines can detonate, similar cycle but triggered by robot cycle)
